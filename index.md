# üëã About me

I am Poornima Jain, PhD student the Department of Artificial Intelligence, IIT-Hyderabad supervised by Dr. Vineeth Balasubramanian. I have a keen interest in the low-level working of neural networks with a focus on applications for computer vision.

## üíº EXPERIENCE
  
**PHD Student, Dept. of Artificial Intelligence, IIT-Hyderabad**

I am working on developing novel unlearning algorithms for continual learning settings, foundational models and developing robust evaluation metrics for unlearning.

**MS-by-Research in Computer Science, IIIT-Bangalore	Aug 2019 ‚Äì Dec 2022**  

- Complex-valued Neural Networks for Accelerated MRI Reconstruction
- Explored the effects of using complex-valued arithmetic in neural networks for application in domains with complex-valued data, specially for the application of accelerated MRI Reconstruction
- Complex-valued gradient-based optimization algorithms, backpropagation, loss functions and neural network operations like convolution, dense layers and activation functions were studied. 
- A new complex-valued activation function, the PlaneReLU, was proposed to address limitations  of existing complex-valued activation functions.
- Experimented with end-to-end complex-valued operations in different SOTA network architectures for MRI Reconstruction - the AUTOMAP, the Primal Dual Net architecture and the Residual Robust Artificial neural network for k-space Interpolation (Residual RAKI) for Parallel MRI. Four datasets of single-coil and multi-coil (Parallel MRI) brain and knee k-space, from fastmri.org and other open-sources, were used.
- Complex-valued neural networks achieved improved or comparable performance w.r.t. standard SSIM, PSNR and NRMSE metrics in all experiments while using 50% fewer learnable parameters than real-valued networks.
- The improved learning in complex-valued neural networks was attributed to the regularization they cause by reducing the degrees of freedom in the neural network.

**Industry Experience July 2022 ‚Äì January 2024, Caterpillst.inc**
- Associate Software Developer, Caterpillar.inc
- Worked on building APIs to send and receive messages from IoT devices using Java Spring Boot and Amazon Web Services tools like DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, CloudWatch.
