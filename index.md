# üëã Hello, I'm Poornima S Jain

Welcome to my personal site. Here's a quick overview of my professional background:

## üíº EXPERIENCE
  
**PHD Student, Dept. of Artificial Intelligence, IIT-Hyderabad**

PHD THESIS : Erasing the Past: ‚ÄúMachine Unlearning‚Äù in Contemporary Neural Network Models

 Machine Unlearning (MU) is an upcoming research field focused on efficiently erasing the influence of certain training data on a model while maintaining its utility. This is especially relevant in the light of recent legislations such as the European Union‚Äôs GDPR (2018) that allow users rights to remove their data from AI models. Most existing MU research is focused on unlearning in vanilla classification tasks with stationary data domains. Unlearning in non-stationary data settings and multimodal vision-language models, including settings such as domain adaptation (where models adapt to new data domains) and continual learning (where models continually learn new tasks) remains largely unexplored. As a first step, we recently proposed an adversarial optimization method to unlearn source-exclusive classes in a source-free domain adaptation setting. Our method outperforms existing baselines on well-known benchmark datasets . Our ongoing efforts include a comprehensive literature survey of MU methods across settings, developing novel unlearning algorithms for continual learning, foundational models and developing robust and comprehensive evaluation metrics to measure the effectiveness of unlearning.

**MS-by-Research in Computer Science, IIIT-Bangalore	Aug 2019 ‚Äì Dec 2022**  

- Complex-valued Neural Networks for Accelerated MRI Reconstruction
- Explored the effects of using complex-valued arithmetic in neural networks for application in domains with complex-valued data, specially for the application of accelerated MRI Reconstruction
- Complex-valued gradient-based optimization algorithms, backpropagation, loss functions and neural network operations like convolution, dense layers and activation functions were studied. 
- A new complex-valued activation function, the PlaneReLU, was proposed to address limitations  of existing complex-valued activation functions.
- Experimented with end-to-end complex-valued operations in different SOTA network architectures for MRI Reconstruction - the AUTOMAP, the Primal Dual Net architecture and the Residual Robust Artificial neural network for k-space Interpolation (Residual RAKI) for Parallel MRI. Four datasets of single-coil and multi-coil (Parallel MRI) brain and knee k-space, from fastmri.org and other open-sources, were used.
- Complex-valued neural networks achieved improved or comparable performance w.r.t. standard SSIM, PSNR and NRMSE metrics in all experiments while using 50% fewer learnable parameters than real-valued networks.
- The improved learning in complex-valued neural networks was attributed to the regularization they cause by reducing the degrees of freedom in the neural network.

**Industry Experience July 2022 ‚Äì January 2024, Caterpillst.inc**
- Associate Software Developer, Caterpillar.inc
- Worked on building APIs to send and receive messages from IoT devices using Java Spring Boot and Amazon Web Services tools like DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, CloudWatch.
